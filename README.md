# Contractility Analyzer

The Contractility Analyzer is an open source ImageJ plugin specifically designed to cell contractility analyzes. It contains two modules.
## Spheroid Perimeter module ##
The Spheroid Perimeter module is looking for the largest cluster of connected pixels on the binary image sequence and calculates the time-dependent perimeter of the spheroid.
## Hole module ##
The Hole module identifies each cell-free areas (holes) as a cluster of connected pixels and determined their areas on the binary image sequence.
